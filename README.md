# Recipes app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), with an express server.

To get started run:

```

  npm install && cd recipes-app-client && npm install
  npm start
  
```

This application uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as a test runner (shipped with Create React App) and [](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for isolated component testing.

To run tests

```

  npm run tests

```
