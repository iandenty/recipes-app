# Recipes app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), with an express server.

To get started clone the repo and `cd` into it, then run:

```

  npm install && cd recipes-app-client && npm install && cd ..
  
```

Ensure that you are in the root app folder `/recipes-app`, then run:

```
  npm start

```

This application uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as a test runner (shipped with Create React App) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for isolated component testing.

To run tests:

```

  npm run test

```
